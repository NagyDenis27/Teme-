     <h3>Beagle Breed</h3>
     <p></p><strong>Origin:</strong> Great Britain <br /><br />
        <strong>Character:</strong> Friendly, active, and highly sociable. They make great family companions and get along well with children and other pets.  <br /><br />
        <strong>Size:</strong> Medium size breed, standing between 13-15 inches high and weighing around 18-20 pounds on average.  <br/><br />
        <strong>Training:</strong>They are clever canines that are eager to please - 
        but they can have a stubborn streak! Beagle puppies will benefit from lots of training and early socialisation.  <br/><br />
        <strong>Noise levels:</strong>These pups have a strong desire to bark. While you won’t be able to curb this completely, 
        training methods will help to keep their howling under wraps. <br/><br />
        <strong>Beagle personality:</strong>The Beagle temperament is next to none. 
        Sweet, affectionate and merry, they make great companion dogs for the right family,
         and get along well with just about everyone. 
         With the right socialisation and training, you'll have a loyal, 
         loving, and playful dog by your side for many years to come. 
         Hey - it's no wonder they are one of the most popular breeds in the United States!
